This project showcases my skills and knowledge in applying data analytics and machine learning to hardware defect management. Using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, I demonstrated my ability to clean raw defect data, build insightful dashboards, and train a predictive model to estimate defect severityâ€”supporting faster and more informed decisions in manufacturing environments.
